# Validator Worldmap

This repository visualizes the distribution of Ethereum validators around the globe, using data from the Ethereum Foundation Robust Incentives Group validator tracking. We fetch this data from a [Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/queries/3867590) query, then plot it on a world map with [GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org).
